          <p>
            I have always had a strong interest in technology and IT. My first
            programming attemps started at school and university, but at the
            beginning of 2017 my passion moved to the next level. I was working
            full time in non-IT environment and during my days off and weekends,
            I started reading and studied more about front-end programming. I
            have done my research and joined many free online platforms, where I
            could communicate and discuss with other members, also start on
            first codes and finally creating project at the end of 2017. I
            wanted to start coding on professional level, which led me to coding
            course in July 2018, where I improved and learnt new coding areas
            and it also allowed to work on projects which you can find on
            Github. Now my main goal is to apply gained skills in working
            environment, as I strive it to become my work career. I am very hard
            working person with strong communication skills. I enjoy working in
            group projects, brainstorming, problem solving and I have got good
            eye to details. I am very flexible when it comes to learning new
            technologies and I am always open to new challenges. Because I am a
            good listener, I always try onboard any constructive criticism and
            feedback, as I know it is the key part of learning curve and my
            personal growth.

          <h3>MY PAST</h3>
          <!-- <h6>pracownik fizyczny</h6> -->
          <p>
            I finished university in Poland and gained a Bachelorâ€™s degree in
            Management at Lublin University of Technology. I think I was not
            mature enough or maybe way too scared to make the right decision
            because I struggled with the choice between Management and Computer
            Science. It is not like I am not grateful for this higher education
            because every new experience can teach me something about myself,
            although computers have accompanied me from my youngest years. I
            still remember when my mother gave my yellow book with general
            knowledge which included information about how to build a computer
            and networks. That event put a mark on me and has slowly evolved to
            the final stage. So right now I would like to challenge myself and I
            am proud that this time I am doing something that is really
            important for me.
          </p>

          <h3>INTEREST</h3>
          <!-- <h6>pracownik fizyczny</h6> -->
          <p>
            I believe that I am realistic person who is strong enough
            emotionally to survive any pressure from bad environment. I am good
            listener with honest attitude to people(sometimes way too
            straightforward :D) . I am passionate about developing myself so I
            always try to find opportunities to learn every day. My main
            activities are programming, running, street workout, reading books
            and technological news, collecting vinyl records, playing electric
            guitar, photography. Another thing worth mentioning is that I really
            appreciate knowledgeable and experienced people who sacrifice their
            free time to share all their abilities and skills with others. One
            day I would like to be like one of them and inspire people to focus
            what is really important in particular area of life.

          <h3>FUTURE PLANS</h3>
          <!-- <h6>pracownik fizyczny</h6> -->
          <p>
            My dream is to be a full stack developer with design and graphics
            skills. Moreover I try to think like a visionary person so I would
            like to continue my path with artificial intelligence. AL is moving
            rapidly from relevancy in technologically niche areas to impacting
            every industry in the world. My main goal is to create a robot or
            application that could really help children with autism. I know
            robots like this already exist but they are not perfect. Basically
            that area is not explored enough(especially in eastern Europe) so I
            would like to put tremendous work and make it better. This has came
            from my personal experience because I know someone who has autism so
            that is not an empty promise. I know how hard is life when you live
            with autistic child. This disorder has had a big influence on my
            close family and has changed their life dramatically. So if I could
            only have the chance to obtain necessary knowledge I will sacrifice
            myself on that project.
